# Homework 12: Employee Tracker

## Description

For this assignment, we were assigned to build a command-line application from scratch to manage a company's employee database, using Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL.

Because this application won't be deployed, I've attached a walkthrough video below to view how it works in the command-line.
